// Use slices when: 
// - you want to borrow a portion of a collection rather than the whole collection
// - you want to pass around a reference to a sequence of items without copying them
// - you want to access a subset of a collection without copying
// Use vectors when:
// - you need to dynamically grow or shrink your collection
// - you need to own the collection and transfer ownership to another scope
